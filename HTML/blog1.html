            <h2>Close Reading</h2>
              <p><b>Li - 2020 - Overview of Data Visualization</b><br>
                <p>In our fast-paced world, where we are bombarded with overwhelming amounts of information, 
                    data visualization has emerged as a valuable tool for analysing complex datasets and
                     presenting discoveries in a meaningful way. It is like transforming a jumble of numbers
                      and facts into visually captivating images. This practice has had a significant impact 
                      on decision making processes across various fields, including science, business, media 
                      and even government policies. So, in this blog post I will delve in and explore the 
                      realm of data visualization. I will investigate Li's renowned work titled 'Overview 
                      of Data Visualization' from the esteemed book 'Embodying Data', which is highly 
                      regarded among experts. My aim is to gain and demonstrate a comprehensive 
                      understanding of its essence and why it holds immense significance in today's data driven world.</p>
    
                <p>In this world driven by data it becomes crucial to have means of visualizing and comprehending 
                    information. All the need, for data literacy among workers keeps growing year after year. 
                    Individuals, at all levels whether they are employees or business owners must possess a 
                    grasp of data and recognize its effects. Data visualization involves an information 
                    exchange that includes the messenger, the receiver, and the message (Li, 2020).The 
                    term “data visualization” has many definitions and has been defined in many ways, 
                    the way I understand and define this term is that data visualization involves 
                    presenting data and information in a format using elements, like charts, 
                    graphs, maps and other visual aids. The main goal of data visualization 
                    is to present datasets in a way that is easy to understand and visually 
                    appealing. It allows viewers to easily identify patterns, trends, correlations, 
                    and insights that may not be immediately apparent when looking at data alone. 
                    In Li’s article it provides many definitions for the term, the definition
                     that most helped me understand this concept is from Manovich (2010) who defines
                      it as “a transformation of quantified data which is not visual into a visual 
                      representation” (p. 20). I really wanted to find out the advantages of data 
                      visualization and why it is so important, after doing some research I 
                      found the following advantages:</p>
                
                <p>1.	Data visualisation aids in processing and comprehension.<br>
                    2.	Data visualisation dashboards appeal to learners by making information more accessible and understandable.<br>
                    3.	By utilising data visualisation technologies, we may unearth insights that might otherwise go unnoticed in reports.<br>
                    4.	Data visualisation assists us in identifying things or tasks that must be performed depending on the information displayed.<br>
                    5.	Data visualisation can boost productivity. Increase sales.<br>
                    </p>
                    
                <p>Data visualization is split into two branches, information visualization and scientific visualization. Li (2020) states 
                    that both information and scientific visualization focus on transforming data into a visual format that can be comprehended, 
                    allowing us to gain insight and knowledge. Information visualization focuses on representing data to facilitate understanding 
                    and exploration whereas scientific visualization deals with visualizing data from technical domains like simulations and 
                    experimental results. Although distinct, from each other both subfields aim to transform data into representations that 
                    enhance comprehension and decision making within their respective domains. The article then goes on to define and explain 
                    the definition of data and information, the definitions may differ based on the context of the disciplines and diverse meanings 
                    in the context of processing and communication. From my understanding “Data” is primarily raw and unprocessed information that 
                    includes facts, measurements, observations, or figures gathered from various sources. It can take several forms, including 
                    numerical data, written material, graphics, audio recordings, and movies. Data in its raw form lacks the context and 
                    significance required to make sense of it. In contrast, information develops when data is analysed and arranged to 
                    provide meaning and context. It represents transformed material that conveys a message, is significant, and assists 
                    in the resolution of specific questions or issues. Information provides us with knowledge and insight, allowing 
                    us to make better decisions and communicate more effectively.
                </p>
    
                  <p>Under the subsection entitled 2.1.3 The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization outlines the several types of data 
                    visualisation and the tools used and how they produce a varied visual impression that can aid in the identification 
                    of problems or concerns. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 provided me with a simple and easy understanding of the various tools 
                    before diving into them in more detailed and lengthy explanation. The tools I found most useful, and I am more 
                    likely to use and see are as follows: 
                  </p>
    
                  <p>•	<b>Charts</b> are visual representations that use graphical elements to display quantitative information.<br>
                    •	 <b>Maps</b> are visual representations that display geographical or spatial data, using colours, patterns, or symbols to show data values.<br>
                    •	 <b>Diagrams</b> are graphical illustrations that depict relationships, structures, processes, or flows.<br>
                    •	 <b>Graphs</b> are visual representations of mathematical relationships between variables, using points and lines on a coordinate plane.<br>
                    •	 <b>Tables</b> are structured formats presenting data in rows and columns for easy comparison and analysis.<br>
                    </p>
    
                <p>From reading and doing research from this article I have learnt that data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that 
                    goes beyond just presenting numbers and statistics. It allows individuals and organizations to gain valuable insights, 
                    identify patterns and make informed choices through visually engaging representations. By transforming complex data 
                    into intuitive visuals, it improves understanding and enables effective communication in various areas such as 
                    scientific research and business analytics. </p>
